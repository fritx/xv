## Features

- __Simple__ - zero-config, no API to learn, out of the box ESM/CJS support
- __Lightweight__ - 6kB and no dependencies
- __Magical__ - simply export test functions, that's all
- __Blazingly fast__ - with almost zero abstractions, xv is as fast as Node
- __Unix philosophyâ„¢__ - `do one thing well`, xv is _only_ a test runner

Used by [lowdb](https://github.com/typicode/lowdb) (local JSON database), [steno](https://github.com/typicode/steno) (fast file writer) and other [awesome projects](https://github.com/typicode/xv/network/dependents).

## Install

```sh
npm install xv --save-dev
```

## Usage

Create a test file and use Node's built-in [`assert`](https://nodejs.org/api/assert.html) module:

```js
// src/add.test.js
import { strict as assert } from 'assert'
import add from './add.js'

// This is plain Node code, there's no xv API
export function testAdd() {
  assert.equal(add(1, 2), 3)
}
```

Edit `package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "xv src"
  }
}
```

Run all test files:

```sh
npm test
```

Run a single test file:

```sh
npx xv src/add.test.js 
```

## Convention

When provided with a directory, xv will look for files named `*.test.js` or `test.js` and run exported functions sequentially.

## TypeScript

To test TypeScript code, compile your `.ts` files and run `xv` on compiled `.js` files. 

For example, assuming your compiled files are in `lib/`, edit `package.json` to run `xv` after `tsc`:

```diff
{
  "scripts": {
-   "test": "xv src"
+   "test": "tsc && xv lib"
  }
}
```

If you're publishing to npm, edit `package.json` to exclude compiled test files:

```diff
{
  "files": [
    "lib",
+   "!lib/**/*.test.js",
+   "!lib/**/test.js"
  ]
}
```

## Common JS

xv can also test CJS code.

```js
// src/add.test.js
const assert = require('assert').strict;
const add = require('./add')

// This is plain Node code, there's no xv API
exports.testAdd = function() {
  assert.equal(add(1, 2), 3)
}
```

## Coverage

You can use c8 with xv.

```sh
npm install c8 --save-dev
```

```diff
{
  "scripts": {
+  "coverage": "c8 xv src",
   "test": "xv src"
  }
}
```

## Watch mode

xv doesn't integrate a watch mode. If the feature is needed, it's recommended to use tools like [watchexec](https://github.com/watchexec/watchexec) or [chokidar-cli](https://github.com/open-cli-tools/chokidar-cli) to re-run xv when there are changes.

## Status

The project being very simple by design, there probably won't be frequent updates to the code (_which is a good thing for you, unless you like Dependabot alerts and updating devDependencies_). It will be updated to support latest Node releases and implement potential improvements. 

__tl;dr__ xv is maintained and used, even though code updates may not be recent.
